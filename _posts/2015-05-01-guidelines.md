Hello there,

Well, this post intends to get you started on using the blog. Currently, it's hosted as a Github Page in my repository. For you to start contributing to the blog, tell me your Github ID, and I can add you as a 'Collaborator' to this repo, after which you can easily start adding posts.

To add a post you need to go to [this](https://github.com/rsrihari/patdata/tree/gh-pages/_posts) directory in the repo, and use the '+' to add a new post. At the top of the new file you are writing, add a header similar to this:

{% highlight ruby %}
---
layout: post
title: Adding Content
author: Srihari
---
{% endhighlight %}

The 'layout' should always be post while you should take care of the other two. Add the rest of the content in Markdown. There is a good [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for quickly working with Markdown by Adam Pritchard. See [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsrihari/patdata/gh-pages/_posts/2015-05-01-guidelines.md) as an example of a post to add. After you are done, commit the changes (the procedures starting here are pretty straightforward).
